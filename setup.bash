# Step 2: Define a unique prefix for environment variables (for example, using PROJECT_NAME or your own)

# Step 3: Set up the environment variable for the project's source directory
export ${PREFIX}_SRC_DIR="$PROJECT_SRC_DIR"

# Step 4: Add the "src" directory of the project to the PYTHONPATH
export PYTHONPATH="$PROJECT_SRC_DIR/src:$PYTHONPATH"

# Step 5: Set up the "data_dir" environment variable based on the project source directory
export ${PREFIX}_DATA_DIR="$PROJECT_SRC_DIR/data"

# Step 6: Set up the "main.db" file acesss

# Step 7: Create dedicated directories for analysis results
